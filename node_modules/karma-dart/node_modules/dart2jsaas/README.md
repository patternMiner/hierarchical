dart2jsaas
==========

Dart2JS-as-a-service is a node.js module which compiles Dart applications to Javascript without any additional configuration.

It is designed to seamlessly port Dartium-centric workflows to production (JS-only) browsers.

How It Works
------------

When dart2jsaas is given the URL of a Dart application, it will crawl all
of the application's dependencies.  The service then feeds the entire set of Dart files to dart2js and returns the generated
Javascript.

Since it fetches data directly from the server, it does not depend on the the filesystem, pub or pubspec.lock.
As long as the app loads correctly in Dartium, dart2jsaas
will be able to compile the app into Javascript.

Don't Repeat Yourself. One Configuration
-----------------

dart2jsaas allow you to use the same deployment configuration for both Dartium and dart2js.  Since dart2jsaas does
not depend on the filesystem, it works with on-the-fly generated Dart code and configurations where code is
served from multiple locations.

Usage
-----

The basic use-case is to listen for ```main.dart.js``` HTTP requests, compile ```main.dart``` and return the response.
This setup works well with dart.js' fallback scheme where if it can't find a Dart VM, it simply requests
```x.dart.js``` in place of the ```x.dart``` script tag.

Middleware for connect / express is included.

Simple, command-line integration is also possible.  See cmdline.js.

Testing
-------

We are using jasmine-node.

npm install jasmine-node -g
jasmine-node spec/
